Question:- Given an array of size n and a range [a, b]. The task is to partition the array around the range such that array is divided into three parts.
1) All elements smaller than a come first.
2) All elements in range a to b come next.
3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to return the modified array.

Example 1:-

Input: 
n = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
[a, b] = [1, 2]
Output: 1

Example 2:-

Input: 
n = 3 
A[] = {1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1}
[a, b] = [1, 3]
Output: 1

time complexity is O(N)

            else{
                swap(array,larger,between);
                larger--;

    public void swap(int array[], int a, int b){
        int temp=array[a];
        array[a] = array[b];
        array[b] = temp;
    }
